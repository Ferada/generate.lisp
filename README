generate.lisp is a simple blog/website compiler
===============================================

Not much documentation at the moment, see the source.

Uses anaphora, cl-who, puri, cl-markdown, local-time and cl-ppcre.
Will additionally use parenscript, css-lite, puri and logv.

Basically the directory structure should be something like this:

/generate.{lisp,asd}, defpackage.lisp
/posts/20090228-foo.md
/media/bar.png

with `20090228-foo.md` being the actual posts in Markdown format and
`media` being the directory for additional files.  The rendered XHTML
files will be in `/`.
